### 6
because the lattice is periodic we can look at a finite region
### 8
Introduce BZ (region closest to the origin)
### 15
uc is equiv to bz
### 16
We will work in the bz, becuase it is convinient with symetry
### 17
We have to perform dificult integral, it takes many rectangles to be accurate
### 18
twice as fast
### 19
next: sampling
### 20
uniform sampling
reduce points by symmetry

non-uniform sampling
reduce volume first, then sample

Next: IBZ ob
